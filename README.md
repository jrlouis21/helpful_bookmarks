# Helpful Bookmarks
The following pages are pages and links that I have collected over time as a reminder to myself and being able to easily find the information I am looking for. 

This page consists of a high level set of bookmarks to the original source data and bookmarks that I don't want to get lost within their original sources :) In general, just a collection of things that I found useful to me and my personal needs.
